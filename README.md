# Inria Sans and Inria Serif

```
Inria Sans and Inria Serif are the two members of a type family design for the communication of Inria, 
a national institut dedicated to numeric research. The Institut needed a font showing its values 
at the crossroad of humanity, technology, excellence and creativity. Black[Foudry] created a humanist 
typeface with a unapologetically contemporary design as the Sans-serif part and a more rational axis 
and drawing for the serif. Both members comes in 3 weights with matching italics.
